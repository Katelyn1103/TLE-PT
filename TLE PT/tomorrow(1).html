<font size="5", style="cambria">With the use of sky lanterns, people would write their wishes and attached them inside. Together with<br>
their loved ones, they release these lanterns into the night sky. The common things that people would<br>
wish for are love, prosperity and success. In the context of what we want to present, the sky lantern<br>
could also symbolize for hopeâ€“in a way that we anticipate the future with bright mindsets and an open<br> 
heart. Hope, for us, is the endless horizon full of possibilities that we wish to reach.<br></font>
